		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img src="index.png" alt="My Friends and I" height="350">
		<p>My name is Bill Kubiak, and I am a freshman at the University of Georgia. My major is accounting; I plan to work as an accountant after I graduate. I am a member of Pi Kappa Phi at UGA and have met all of my best friends at college through my fraternity as it can be seen in the picture to the left. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, but my parents still lived in Syracuse, New York at the time. I moved with my mom and dad to Georgia when I was three. We bought a house in Lawrenceville, Georgia, and I lived there until I moved to Athens to go to school.</p><br>
		<p>I went to elementary school at Freeman's Mill, and I met most of my lifelong friends here. After 5th grade, most of my friends and I moved on to Twin Rivers Middle school. Here I met even more people and continued making great friendships.  I went to and graduated from Mountain View High School in 2016. After graduation, I chose to continue my education at UGA.</p><br>
		<p>Until this year, I had played baseball all my life, and it became a big part of my life. My love for the game drove me to begin umpiring in the fall of 2013, which I have not stopped since. I have worked a few jobs over my lifetime, and each one has taught me skills that I still carry in my lifetime.</p><br>
